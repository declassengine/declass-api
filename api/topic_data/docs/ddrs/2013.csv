July 18, 1956. 2 p. Encl: Same title [Soviet control of Eastern Europe contributed to a power disequilibrium in Europe, creating a threat to US security. The Soviets have made progress in exploiting the industrial capacity and expanding the military capability of the Satellites. Impediments to consolidation of Soviet control include the anti-Communist attitude of the great majority in each country, continued nationalistic sentiment, and the Western refusal to accept the permanence of the imposed Satellite regimes. However, Soviet dominance remains firm, with little prospect for change and no known underground groups capable of sustained resistance. Changes in the USSR since Stalin\'s death have been reflected in current developments in the Satellites. Moscow now seems to recognize the advantages of using greater flexibility and to camouflage its control. Nationalism remains a disruptive force in Soviet-Satellite relations; Tito\'s successful defiance provides an example to others. US strategy with respect to the German problem and the Satellite issue are linked. The inability of the US to include the Satellite problem on its negotiating agenda with the USSR has reduced the hopes of the Satellite peoples. On the other hand, East Germans are unlikely to accept the Communist regime; the West German example keeps German hopes alive. The denigration of Stalin and acceptance of Titoism has caused the Satellites to question the infallibility of Soviet leadership. This fluid situation has increased the US capability to influence basic change in Soviet domination of the satellites]. Statement of Policy. 7 p. TOP SECRET. SANITIZED copy. Released Dec. 27, 1979.
