Encl: (A) Same title [in the spring of 1943, a Chief of Staff to the Supreme Allied Commander (COSSAC) was appointed and instructed to prepare a plan for an emergency operation in the event of a sudden collapse of Germany. Codenamed RANKIN, the plan divided Germany into British and US zones. In Nov. 1943, the President instructed the Combined Chiefs of Staff that he desired the US zone of occupation in Germany to be in the north and to extend as far east as Berlin. In Jan. 1944, at the European Advisory Commission (EAC), the British put forward a proposal that they occupy the northern zone, the boundaries of which would leave Berlin well within the Soviet zone. The Soviet representative later proposed zones of occupation identical to those suggested by the UK. In April 1944, the President approved the JCS proposal to concur in the British-Soviet line but to adhere to the original request that US forces occupy the northern zone. In Sept. 1944, at the OCTAGON conference, the President agreed to a compromise that assigned the US the southern zone but reserved control of Bremen and Bremerhaven for the US commander].
