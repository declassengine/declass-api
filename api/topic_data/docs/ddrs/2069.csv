To this must be added the increasingly strong possibility of dangerous disorder and harassment from protest activities planned by assorted political groups. As a consequence, extraordinary security measures have been planned and implemented. The Chicago Police Department (CPD) meets daily with the Secret Service and FBI. The CPD\'s security plans for the convention and general vicinity of the area are outlined. Arrangements have been made for housing prisoners in the event of mass arrests. Sen. McCarthy has told his supporters to hold rallies in their hometowns to avoid unintended violence or disorder. An estimated 30-40,000 antiwar protesters may come to Chicago. The number of demonstrators may swell to 100,000 if other groups are added. Plans of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam are discussed in some detail as well as the activities of smaller organizations including the Youth International Party and the Coalition for an Open Convention.
