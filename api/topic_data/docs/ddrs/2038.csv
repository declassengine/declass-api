Quadros\'s resignation and Goulart\'s assumption of the presidency coincided with the formation of the Alliance for Progress, which viewed the problems in the northeast of Brazil as a crucial test for the Alliance. The US agreed to extend $119 million for a northeast assistance program in April 1962. In 1963 $398.5 million was released in support of the Three Year Economic Development Plan for Brazil. In June of 1963, the Brazilian finance minister, Santiago Dantas, resigned after his stabilization efforts failed. His successors also made no progress, and the US suspended balance of payments assistance and continued only PL 480 wheat sales. The US lending strategy became one of supporting friendly states within Brazil and strengthening the image of the Alliance for Progress and US in such a way as not to strengthen Goulart\'s national govt. The new govt. following the coup in April 1964 promptly received balance of payments support and stepped-up project loan commitments to tide the govt. over until its stabilization and reform program can be launched in the fall of 1966].
