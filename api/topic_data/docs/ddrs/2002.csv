UN initiatives and a four-nation conference resulted in an amelioration of the situation in 1953-54, when the ROC government evacuated 5,500 of the troops and their dependents, publicly disavowed the irregulars, and agreed to cut off further support. However, since 1958, the ROC\'s interest in the irregulars has revived, arms supplies have been resumed, and ROC armed forces personnel have been brought into the area. Chiang Kai-shek sees the irregulars as the spearhead of a future recovery of the mainland, but in the US view the presence of the irregulars offers an opportunity for Chinese Communist intervention, hampers cooperation among non-Communist nations in Southeast Asia, and sours relations with Burma.
