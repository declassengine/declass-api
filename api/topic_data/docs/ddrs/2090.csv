The Soviet economy is better prepared to support a major war effort than it was in 1940. The principal emphasis of the recent bloc military program was to enlarge the atomic stockpile and to improve defenses, especially against air attack; however, it is unlikely that the USSR will be able to develop and produce a thermonuclear weapon by mid-1953. Soviet forces now in Eastern Europe are in an advanced state of readiness for war and can attack with little or no warning. It is estimated that the bloc has the capabilities to undertake concurrent large-scale operations in continental Europe, the Middle East, and mainland Asia. It is capable of sustained air offensives against the UK, most of continental Europe, most of the Middle East, and Japan, and is also capable of undertaking delivery of its full stockpile of atomic weapons against these targets and against the US and its overseas bases. Bloc air defenses are capable of vigorous opposition to an air offensive against principal Soviet centers; however, deficiencies will remain throughout the period of the estimate. The USSR has the capability to undertake offensive submarine patrols and mining operations along most of the world\'s vital sea lanes. The Communists will not be capable of overthrowing any non-Communist government either by constitutional processes or by revolution, except possibly in Iran. Bloc capability for political warfare, conducted through the Kremlin-controlled Communist parties, will continue to constitute a serious danger for the non-Communist world. Factors affecting bloc capabilities (including the regime\'s control in the USSR and over the Satellites, Sino-Soviet relations, and economic development), bloc military strength and capabilities, and bloc political warfare strengths and capabilities area by area are discussed].
