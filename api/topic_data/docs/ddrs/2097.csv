If Pakistan has made similar drops in India, it would also seem a waste of good men. Communal tensions in New Delhi seem close to the surface. The US flag has been burned at a demonstration at the Am Consul in Lahore; shots have been fired at a US communications facility in Peshawar. Pakistan has asked foreign visitors to leave and diplomats to stay in the cities where they are stationed. U Thant has arrived in Pakistan and has said that he had suggestions for a settlement. Iran will give Pakistan aid to boost morale. The SYG of SEATO says that it will not respond to Pakistani requests. The Canadian ambassador reports that Shastri is in an uncompromising mood. Ayub has told the Shah that the lack of a US response to Pakistani appeals for aid is probably due to a US desire to see Pakistan destroyed].
