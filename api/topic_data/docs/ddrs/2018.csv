(3) The system of ARVN- and Montagnard-manned base camps along the Laotian and Cambodian borders has done little to halt Communist infiltration. A concentrated counterinsurgency effort along the border and government-to-government actions should be considered. (4) The situation in the delta continues to be troublesome since the abundance of food precludes the use of hunger as a weapon; the profusion of waterways facilitates guerrilla infiltration, smuggling, and escape to Cambodian sanctuary; the terrain decreases Vietnamese vehicular mobility, and the delta population is resistant to central authority.
