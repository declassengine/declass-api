Bidault also spoke at length about Indochina and said that the French felt the military situation was better than it had been for some time. On Egypt, Churchill had wanted discussion with only the US. His main point, expressed later in a letter, was to request more positive US support of the UK position re a Suez base. Churchill held the view that many countries now seeking independence were unaware of the responsibilities that go with that status.

Technically, there has not been a break between the two states; they both still profess allegiance to Marxism-Leninism, and they still include each other in the Socialist camp although their interpretations of Communist doctrine can no longer be said to be common. Albania has become the testing ground of both camps\' resolve. The Soviets, in trying to bring down the Hoxha regime, hope to discourage other parties from defying Moscow. By upholding Hoxha, the Chinese hope to show the effectiveness of their support to Communist regimes closer to their own borders. The USSR\'s most effective political pressure on China would be the repudiation of the friendship treaty. The Soviets have already played their most effective economic card, withdrawing their technicians from China. The Soviets could also demand repayment of China\'s debt, but China would probably refuse, and the USSR would have to break off trade relations and probably diplomatic relations. Military force will not be used by the Soviets to force China to conform. Little chance exists that Mao will be successfully challenged by pro-Soviet elements within China. The Soviets will probably apply some of the remaining pressures available upon China before breaking with the Chinese party. The prospects for a complete break are marginal].
