Memorandum, CSARM 21-58, Chief of Staff, Air Force, to the JCS. Jan. 16, 1958. 1 p.; App: Same title [the following are considered inherent weaknesses of the warning system: there is no warning capability against submarine-launched missiles of the Regulus type; high-altitude flights will overfly current radar coverage, except where AN/FPS-20 radar is installed; lowaltitude flights are likely to be undetected, particularly at night; and the seaward extensions of the distant warning line have a limited capability. There are 17 installations that will have zero warning times against submarine-launched missiles. Thirty-two installations will have from zero to approximately two hours\' warning assuming simultaneous penetrations of the contiguous radar coverage are made at altitudes above 2,000 and below 50,000 feet. If a simultaneous air attack is made on part or all of the bases listed in CINCSAC\'s letter and maximum exploitation of inherent weaknesses is utilized, no warning time can be guaranteed to any base].
