The \""impressive\"" Soviet ICBM development program reported in 1975 is nearing completion, and all four of the missiles have started or will soon start operational deployment. The SS-19 is the most successful new missile and will probably contain six independently targeted warheads which are designed to be \""highly accurate\"" for use against \""hard targets.\"" Two of the missiles, the SS-17 and SS-18, are to be \""cold-launched\"" from their silos; as there will be no damage to the launchers, they can be reused. Further modifications to the Soviet submarine fleet indicate that the Soviets intend to exceed the \""base line\"" ceiling of 740 ship-based launchers and move toward the maximum limit of 950 \""modern\"" SLBM launchers and 62 \""modern ballistic missile submarines.\"" Substantial evidence has been received indicating the submarine weapons may be MIRVed.

The most important development is the Soviet demonstration of a MIRV technology that is more comprehensive than was estimated by the US one year before. The Soviets are also testing post-boost vehicles (PBV) for their MIRVed warheads and for improving the CEP of their single warheads. The PBV is employed on all their new missiles, the SS-X-16, SS-X-17, SS-X-18, and SS-X-19. New silos, guidance modes, warheads, and launch techniques are being developed and pose a \""very serious threat to our ICBMs in their silos, even after the silos are upgraded.\"" A new sub-launched missile with multiple warheads is also under development.
