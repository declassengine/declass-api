Encl.: [To properly assess the feasibility of establishing an educational satellite network, the educational utility, technical sophistication, and economic impact of television on the recipient nations must be studied. General considerations for establishing an educational satellite should include: whether programming will be undertaken by the US alone, the US with consultation with the recipient nation, or a multilateral body such as the UN; whether such a system will adversely affect the Intelsat negotiations in 1969; whether educational satellite broadcasting should be handled under the Intelsat system; whether such a system will goad the USSR into establishing a system of its own; whether the system should be tied in some way to the USIA overseas information program; whether the world information transfer network studies now being considered should be pursued by the US; and whether the system should be tied into international educational programs being undertaken by HEW, AID, State, the Peace Corps, and others.] Paper, White House Working Group on Educational Communications Satellites. 7 p.
