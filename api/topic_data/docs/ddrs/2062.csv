The industry is operating at 40 percent below capacity, and prospects remain dismal with diminishing world demand and increased competition from Japan, Spain, and Eastern Europe. EEC steelmakers face high production costs and excess capacity, and most of them are in financial difficulty. Most member governments have responded with subsidies to cover operating losses; political constraints have kept them from facing up to the need to cut costs by closing plants and reducing employment. The EEC Commission has moved from guidelines to mandatory minimum prices to help hold up the price of steel. However, lack of control over import prices has left a gaping hole in the program. A minimum import price support system has been adopted for the first quarter of 1978 during which the EEC Commission will try to negotiate bilateral price agreements. With an anticyclical program taking effect, efforts will now be directed toward a coordinated approach to structural deficiencies. New, more efficient facilities must replace less productive plants. Members will be encouraged to reduce capacity through the orderly shutdown of older plants and to modernize others. The EEC Commission has proposed that all EEC producers match any capacity additions with retirements and that financial assistance be provided to help firms modernize and provide new jobs for displaced workers].
