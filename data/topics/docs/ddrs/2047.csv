In view of repeated calls for a bombing pause in order to Air Transport Service [the primary mission of MATS is to maintain an air transport capability to meet the DOD\'s wartime airlift requirements; its secondary mission is to contribute to the combat readiness of the DOD establishments. Air Force Under Secy Douglas responds to the following requests from the committee regarding MATS: the basis for determination of the number of aircraft to be assigned to MATS; the number of hours by type and model that it is planned to fly the aircraft assigned to the organization during FY 1958; the policy to be followed with respect to the assignment of cargo and passengers to MATS and commercially-operated aircraft; the policies to be followed in dividing DOD peacetime traffic between MATS and commercial carriers; the routes to be regularly serviced by MATS; the policies to be followed in contracting for commercial airlift; the policies to be followed in leasing aircraft owned by the DOD to private operators; the extent to which transport aircraft are to be retained by other operating elements of DOD and the purpose for which they are to be used; a statement of the accounting principles to be followed in determining the costs and the method by which the using agencies are to reimburse the Industrial Fund operations. A long-range look at the overall airlift requirements is needed. As long as the US must maintain deterrent strength, the capability of immediate reaction for support of strategic forces must be preserved. Airlift requirements of all types have shown steady increases over the past years; preliminary indications point toward continued growth of overall requirements. The possibility of having to operate nonstop over longer distances must also be considered. A biographical sketch of Under Secy Douglas is included]. Presentation, James H.
