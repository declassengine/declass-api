Encl: Presidential Advisory Committee on Telecommunications Policy and Organization [internationally, the US has fallen behind in the communications field because of a lack of central authority, British advances in establishing worldwide networks, unrealistic competition among its carriers, and high rates. Domestically, Western Union cannot be divested of its overseas operations because it would fold; AT&T is encroaching on the Western Union system, and Western Union\'s operating area is shrinking. With regard to national security, a state of \""undeclared electromagnetic warfare\"" exists with the Soviet bloc; the Soviets have a greater jamming capacity than the US, US systems are all vulnerable, and the US does not have the capability to sustain a psychological offensive on a large scale. More work needs to be done on frequency management and allocation. The US has no comprehensive policy, its communication authority is in conflict, and until there is centralization it will be unable to assert effective leadership].

The first is to establish a single, unified, international telecommunication system, which would be economical, efficient, compatible with the military system, and necessitate only one company dealing with foreign organizations for broadcast or transmission rights. The second alternative is to establish two competing international systems, one telephone and the other telegraph, which would be politically more acceptable. There is a need to integrate the long-haul military systems and other government systems and coordinate them with commercial systems.
