A transition would take place until the 19-year age group would be the first called. If the current system of oldest man first should be retained, in FY 1969, college graduates would be 55 percent of the projected draft calls. The concentration of college graduates would be particularly high in July-December 1968, rising to two thirds or more of those called. The median draft age would also rise from 20.5 to 23. Initiation of a modified age class system in the first half of CY 1968 is the most practicable way of dealing with this problem. The effect would be to reduce college graduate inductions from the estimated 55 percent to 20 percent and the projected median draft age from 23 to 20.8. Even under this system, the number of college graduates inducted would be substantially higher than under the earlier system of liberal student deferments.
