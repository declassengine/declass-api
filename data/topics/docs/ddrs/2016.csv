The Secy of Treasury states that the problems with the military and economic aid and what, if any, advantages might accrue from including military aid in the military budget. Adm. Radford states that the military aid amounts to about $3 billion per annum of the total $4.2 billion aid program. He indicates that new, expensive weapons would increase overall expenditures although manpower might go down. He also comments upon the problem of renegotiating the agreement for bases in Morocco, which the US originally obtained from the French, and outlines the military situations in Thailand, South Vietnam, and Korea. He comments on the long-range prognosis for internal stability in the Soviet Union and Communist China. The Admiral gives a pessimistic appraisal of the Greek-Turkish dispute over Cyprus and observes that the Greeks are the troublemakers.
