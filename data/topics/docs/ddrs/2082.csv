Encl: U.S. Command Structure in the Far East [the present command structure is based on two major considerations that are no longer valid: the requirement for military occupation of Japan and the existence of a friendly China on the mainland of Asia. The most serious deficiencies of the present structure derive from the fact that military responsibility for the Far East-Southeast Asia area is divided among three major commands that are not fully coordinated. The command structure should be designed primarily to wage general war against Communist forces and governments in Asia, to permit prompt and effective reaction to deter or counter local Communist aggressions, and to provide effectively for the defense of Japan and other areas in the region essential to US security interests. Three possible solutions are offered. Designation of a single commander with responsibility for the entire Far East-Southeast Asia area would be essential to the successful prosecution of a general war or a major war with the PRC alone. Consolidation under one command of all military regions pertaining to the Far East, Southeast Asia, and Western Pacific, with another command for the remainder of the Pacific Ocean, is also an alternative. A consolidated Pacific and Far East command is another structure that would resolve problems in the present arrangement]. Memorandum, Gen. J. E. Hull, to Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway. 7 p. SECRET.

Encl.: Same title [Chinese Nationalist forces who retreated from Yunnan Province in 1949-50 and established themselves in northeast Burma have received supplies and assistance from the Republic of China and have been an irritant to the Burmese and a source of friction in US relations with Burma, Thailand, and the ROC. UN initiatives and a four-nation conference resulted in an amelioration of the situation in 1953-54, when the ROC government evacuated 5,500 of the troops and their dependents, publicly disavowed the irregulars, and agreed to cut off further support. However, since 1958, the ROC\'s interest in the irregulars has revived, arms supplies have been resumed, and ROC armed forces personnel have been brought into the area. Chiang Kai-shek sees the irregulars as the spearhead of a future recovery of the mainland, but in the US view the presence of the irregulars offers an opportunity for Chinese Communist intervention, hampers cooperation among non-Communist nations in Southeast Asia, and sours relations with Burma. Chiang has been resistant to increased US pressure and generally disregards US representations on the problem. It may be necessary and possible to force Chiang\'s cooperation by limited, selective cessation of US military aid to the ROC]. Report. 5 p. TOP SECRET. SANITIZED copy. Released Mar. 23, 1981.
