It is an example and symbol of the US determination and ability to defend the free parts of the world against Communist aggression. US rights in Berlin are based on the military defeat of Nazi Germany; the right of the three powers (US, UK, and France) to occupy Berlin and to have access to the city cannot be altered by any action on the part of the Soviets. The three powers have been careful to preserve the essential elements of the separate status of Berlin from the FRG in order to deny the Soviets grounds for denouncing the agreement establishing the quadripartite status of Berlin. To date, the Soviets have maintained formal control over three-power access to Berlin. However, a separate peace treaty between the USSR and GDR would give the East Germans such control and would be a clear violation of US rights. The US and others have refused to recognize the GDR because there is in actuality no such country; it is really only one of the several occupation zones in Germany.

Ultimate objectives are to separate Germany from the West, prevent German acquisition of nuclear weapons, and gain US withdrawal of forces. Soviet statements on Berlin are part of a larger effort to force Western de facto recognition of East Germany and to promote confederation of the two Germanies. These pressures are complemented by Soviet support for a peace treaty with Germany and ostensible disengagement in Central Europe through a revised Rapacki Plan (for a non-nuclear zone in Central Europe and reduced conventional forces). Increased East German functions in Berlin are designed to force the West to choose between working with the East German regime or restricting its own activities to avoid dealings with the GDR. Even qualified recognition of the East would have an adverse effect on internal opposition to the GDR. Forceful action by the Soviets is unlikely. Rather, as Soviets apply pressure, they offer an \""alternative solution\"" designed to make them appear more reasonable, all the while leading the West toward acquiescence on confederation and neutrality for Germany. Most likely overt acts by the Soviets are formal transfer of powers in Berlin to GDR, transfer to GDR of control of Allied surface access to West Berlin, use of East German air traffic controllers in Berlin, and increase in Communist political activity in West Berlin].

The Soviet position re four-power status of Berlin is unclear. While the Bolz-Zorin exchange, the first serious challenge to the Western position in Berlin since the blockade, transfers to the GDR control of its borders and of lines of communication except for Allied military movement, the actual situation regarding access remains unchanged. However, the Soviets will probably push some aspects of the transfer of responsibility in order to press for recognition of the GDR. The Soviets\' ultimate objective is considered to be the expulsion of Allies from Berlin and extension of Communist control to Western sectors. Intermediate goal is isolation of West Berlin to greatest degree possible. Immediate goal is to use West Berlin\'s exposed position to gain recognition of East German regime. Soviets are not likely to launch a military attack, as that would be met with force and probably lead to general war, and they will not attempt another total land blockade, as West has shown ability to get around by air. Thus, the Soviets will probably try to achieve their objectives in a step-by-step process designed to minimize Western reaction].
