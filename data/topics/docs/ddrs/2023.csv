The more fundamental problem was the inability of the monetary system to provide for regular and adequate additions to international reserves. The US opposed increasing the price of gold, seeking to solve the liquidity problem through creation of Special Drawing Rights (SDR\'s). Preliminary agreement for SDR\'s in Sept. 1967 failed to calm the markets. After UK devaluation, the President reaffirmed the US commitment to convertibility at $35 an ounce. Gold pool countries met the weekend of Nov. 25, issuing a strong statement that had a positive effect on the market. By the December meeting in Basle, some erosion in European support for the pool was evident. Two other factors increased the risks of further crisis: a deterioration in US balance of payments and US gold losses, which caused reserves to near the 25 percent legal requirement of reserves to notes issued. The drain continued, cumulatively mounting in Jan. and Feb. Congressional hearings on gold cover legislation and doubts about passage of the tax bill (part of the balance of payments program) increased pressures, as did the impression that the sterling devaluation was not working. Within the government policy discussions centered on four categories: putting US gold on the line to stop a run, establishing a managed private market for gold, establishing a two-tier price system for gold, and suspending gold sales. By the week of Mar. 11, with the speculative fever out of control, the President\'s advisors reached near agreement on a scenario: close the London market and call gold pool members to Washington, seek agreement to reaffirm the $35 an ounce price, announce future reserves would be in SDR\'s, pledge not to buy gold in the private market, discontinue gold pool, create a two-tier system, and arrange for new sterling credits and for agreement on cooperative financial actions. If the US could not get agreement on these proposals, it would temporarily suspend gold convertibility of the dollar and call for an international monetary price. On March 14, after passage of the gold cover legislation, the President decided on immediate closing of the gold market and a US negotiating position ruling out a change in the price of gold. Agreement was reached in Washington on a two-tier price system including almost all the elements in the US position, making it unnecessary to suspend gold convertibility]. Report. [1968.] 13 p.

ddrs,,1980100100056,"Balance of Payments Report, Weekly [during the past two weeks, moderate deficits relations with China and China\'s forces are squared off against the Soviets, current Asian force planning is still based on the assumption of a major US war with China. Defense planning has not fully reflected either the Soviet Union\'s threat to US interests in Asia or the significance of the Sino-Soviet split, relations with Japan, US withdrawal from Vietnam and the emergence of four middle-level states with a significant capacity for military action (two Vietnams and two Koreas), economic rivalries and disputes over the continental shelf, the importance of US position in SE Asia in defending its interests in the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf, and changing combat technology. In light of these considerations, the US has four defense alternatives: (1) focus on the USSR, use the Chinese as a counterweight, and maintain the capability to oppose the Soviets, but not the Chinese, in Asia; (2) partially disengage from the Asian mainland (i.e., Korea), seek to avoid automatic involvement in an Asian land war, and recognize that it may not be desirable to develop too great an intimacy with the PRC; (3) decide that there will be no land wars in Asia (based on the premise that the Sino-Soviet split will restrain the PRC and USSR from attacking US Asian allies) and plan forces so that the US could oppose a PRC or Soviet attack on Japan, Taiwan, or LOC\'s, but not on the mainland; (4) limit US presence in Asia, relying on allies to contribute to their own defense but protecting LOC\'s].
