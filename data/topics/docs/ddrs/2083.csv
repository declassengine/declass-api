Encl.: Same title [US objective toward the Eastern European Satellite area has been to encourage, as the first step toward independence, the emergence of \""national\"" Communist governments. Developments in Poland appear favorable to the attainment of this objective. The Gomulka government has proclaimed its national independence and equality and asserted its right to pursue its own road to socialism, though declaring its continued allegiance to Moscow. In Poland, as in Hungary, recent developments have revealed strong anti-Soviet and anti-Communist sentiments in the population; unlike Hungary, the existence of a strong leadership, fear of a reunified Germany, and the timely promise of reforms have won the government the acquiescence, if not support, of the majority of Poles. In Hungary, a nationalist movement became a revolt when Soviet troops intervened, and the demands of the people became anti-Communist as well as anti-Soviet. The Soviet response was to install a puppet regime and greatly increase its armed forces. The example of Hungary illustrates that the Soviets are willing to use force to prevent the coming into power of a non-Communist government. Policy conclusions for the US are that Soviet control in Eastern Europe is dependent on the presence of Soviet forces and that the USSR will not take steps increasing the risk of general war unless the US intervenes overtly. Therefore, the US should press the Gomulka government to fulfill its reform objectives, increase contacts with Poland, and develop economic relations. The US should mobilize all appropriate pressures, including UN action, to force the termination of harsh Soviet measures against Hungary. If Hungary becomes as independent as Poland, aid should be made available, exchanges increased, and Hungarian trade reoriented towards the West].

In at least those countries where Soviet troops are stationed, the USSR is willing to use its armed forces to prevent a non-Communist government from coming to power or to prevent a Communist government from altering a policy of close alliance with the USSR.
