Post-World War II developments can be divided into three phases: salvage and conversion to civilian production from 1945-47, utilization of refurbished plants and development of techniques learned during the war from 1947-49, and serial production of the T-54 medium tank, JS-III heavy tank, and corresponding assault guns from 1949 to the present. The high degree of centralization in the industry, where tank plants are in close proximity to other heavy equipment facilities and steel production plants, allows for quick conversion of all facilities to tank and gun production. The present tank inventory is 59,398 units. Full mobilization of Soviet forces would require 76,000 tanks.
